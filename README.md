# Other Engine

## Building

Only supports Windows at the moment

To build the engine, you have python version 3+ installed and then run the following commands:

```bash
    python3 cli.py gensln
    python3 cli.py buildsln
```
> you can also open `OtherEngine.sln` created by the first command and build in Visual Studio
